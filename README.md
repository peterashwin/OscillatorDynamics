# OscillatorDynamics
Java application for real time simulation of coupled phase oscillator networks. This project was written initially by John Wordsworth (@JohnWordsworth) with later additions by Peter Ashwin (@peterashwin) and David Leppla-Weber (@David96) at the University of Exeter, UK.

The system simulated consists of N identical phase oscillators of Kuramoto style, but with arbitrary coupling function.

Here is a screenshot of the program in action:

You can change the number of oscillators (N), the range of the coupling (R) as well as the coupling/phase interaction function via the "Parameters" or "Graph" windows. 

Have fun!
